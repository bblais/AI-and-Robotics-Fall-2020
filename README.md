## Racecar

* based off of https://github.com/erwincoumans/pybullet_robots/blob/master/f10_racecar.py
* documentation for PyBullet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#heading=h.2ye70wns7io3
* robot designs https://github.com/erwincoumans/pybullet_robots


My simple_racecar.py tries to make a wrapper around the details, to make the implementation of driving agents which give actions and receive sensor information as easy as possible.

### To Dos

* figure out how to get it to work within a jupyter notebook without hanging
* have a more interesting surface
* place some other objects
* make an agent to do something -- like drive toward another object
* get the Lidar sensor working
*
